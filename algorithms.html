      <p class="a">Welcome to the Algorithms page. The following algorithms (barring random) are all sorting algorithms. When the start button is pressed, they are fed a shuffled list of eight numbers to sort. After each pass through the list, the list is played as a C harmonic minor scale with the numbers 0-7 representing the scale tones. The algorithms will always end by playing the full scale.</p><br>
      <p class="a">The random button plays "random" tones until stopped. All tones in random (as is the case for the sorting algorithms as well) are made using a standard Tone.js synth using a collection of notes within the key of C harmonic minor. Random tones is not truly random -- the notes that are played are randomly selected from a list of notes without replacement, meaning all notes in the list will play before any one note is played twice. This allows for a more random sounding result than sampling with replacement would allow for.</p><br>
